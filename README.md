After creating this object, we can add new Branch type objects into branches
variable. Doing so we increase object depth by one. Into created objects we can
add again new branches etc. In the figure below we have similar structure. This
structure depth is 5.

## Second part of the task
Please write a program, where you would create similar structure. Pass this structure into your own
created method and calculate the depth of provided structure. Main requirement to complete this
task: use recursion.
